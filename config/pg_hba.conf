# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# "local" 用于Unix域socket连接，只有在支持Unix域socket的系统上才会出现
# DATABASE can be "all", "sameuser", "samerole", "replication", a database name,
# or a comma-separated list thereof. The first line that matches is used.
# USER can be "all", a user name, a group name prefixed with "+", or a comma-
# separated list thereof. In both the DATABASE and USER fields you can also
# write a file name prefixed with "@" to include names from a separate file.
# ADDRESS specifies the set of hosts the record matches. It can be a host name,
# or it is made up of an IP address and a CIDR mask that is an integer (between
# 0 and 32 (IPv4) or 128 (IPv6) inclusive) that specifies the number of
# significant bits in the mask. A host name that is all zeros refers to all
# hosts. You can also write "all" to match any IP address, "samehost" to match
# any of the server's own IP addresses, or "samenet" to match any address in any
# subnet that the server is directly connected to.
# METHOD can be "trust", "reject", "md5", "password", "scram-sha-256",
# "gss", "sspi", "ident", "peer", "pam", "ldap", "radius" or "cert". Note that
# "password" sends passwords in clear text; "md5" or "scram-sha-256" are
# preferred since they send encrypted passwords.
